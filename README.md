Murmur2
====

A basic "refactor" of Murmur2 hashing methods so they are ANSI C compatible and yield the same results.  Long story short, needed it
for something :)

A basic Scons build file is included (sconstruct) to build "libmurmur2.so"


### Credits
  All credit should go to Austin Appleby, the main project is hosted over at [googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/)
  and much appreciation for making the code public domain.
